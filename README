This is Liam Bailey's fork of the Nivo Gallery plugin. The Nivo Gallery plugin has a default black space between images.
A client asked me to remove the black space between images so with no option for this I forked the plugin.

Nivo Gallery is "The world's most awesome jQuery Image Gallery". See http://nivogallery.dev7studios.com for more info.
